### The key learning points are to:
* Make an element draggable by adding the ‚Äúdraggable‚Äù attribute
* Make an area droppable by implementing the ‚Äúdragover‚Äù event
* Capture the drag data by implementing the ‚Äúdragstart‚Äù event
* Capture the drop by implementing the ‚Äúdrop‚Äù event
* Implement the ‚Äúdrag‚Äù event that is fired as the element is being dragged
* Store the intermediate data in the dataTransfer object
